IMPORTANT - as I went to upload my completed CSS I recieved an error message from GITPOD and I cant commit or push my completed CSS. The error message stated the following.

All of the work I completed was local so I am unable to pull files from anywhere. The project is due in on 31/10/21 at 12 Noon. 
I understand that I am going to initially fail this project but this issue is out of my control and completley outside of my capabilites 
(or the majority of people at this point in the course). I feel that this issue has unfairly put me in a positon of failing so when possible I would like to discuss re-submissions.
I can show and prove that I have completed the work within this read.me but it will not be applied to the finished website that will be seen.

  THIS IS THE READ ME FILE AS INTENDED! 
  
  
 

**Introduction:**

Hodgey’s fish and chips is a fictitious restaurant business based loosely on a real life takeaway based in Hertfordshire UK that I worked for a as a delivery driver in the beginning six months of the covid-19 pandemic. The website offers information about the service provided, contact details, details of how to find the restaurant, a form for pre-booking a table and external links to third party delivery websites. The website consists of four pages. The home page with opening times and blurb of the business, a menu page, book a table page and a contact us page.

**UX:**

My overall aim was to have a responsive website that gave a feel of the seaside through images and colour, this is the tone set throughout. I wanted it to be uncluttered and easy to navigate. 
A further aim was to clearly offer both parts of the restaurant and takeaway service and I have done this through a dedicated booking page and external links to delivery sites. 

**Home page:**

On the home I wanted a design that gave a quick synopsis of the service provided. A Navigation bar that was clear and was within the blue colour scheme that represents the seaside and a title that
clearly stated both restaurant & takeaway. In the centre is a jumbotron of a seafront in a coastal town in Devon called Brixham which I think is eyecatching for the user. Then underneath is useful information about opening times.

**Menu Page:** 

Throughout the design I used the CSS framework bootstrap to ensure that I was making a fully responsive website that would work from mobile device upwards. The framework was useful for placing the menu options It is split into the three items per row. Fish, burgers, pies then extras, drinks and desserts. I us used the bootstrap classes row and  col-sm-4 to achieve this. I deliberately wanted to keep this page as simple as possible and avoid images as a rule of thumb in the food world is that establishments are usually nicer if they don’t have pictures of the food next to the menu.

**Book-a-table:**

This page is a form for the user too interactive with in order to pre-book a table. To keep within the seaside image on this occasion I used a centered jumbotron of Bangor harbour in Wales. 
Underneath  this jumbotron is a centered form that I created which contains all of the information needed in order to book a table. Customers name, contact details times and date they want and amount of guests. I wanted to keep this form as wide as possible in order for the user to clearly see what input are needed in the form. In this case I used the classes row  and col-md-6 for placement.

**Contact us.** 

the main focus of the contact page for the user is the map of how to find the restaurant. For this and the address that is underneath and centered I put the address of the Fish & chip takeaway that I used to work for. I also put the address and contact number. In the footer there is a link to the newsletter so the restaurant has the option of creating a mail out if they would like.

**Wireframe:** 
   
The wireframe that I created was designed using Balsamiq Wireframes. I created the four pages that I wanted using the wireframe and where possible I stuck to this guide. Although there are some parts that I later decided against such as logo’s on the external links and using dropdown menus in the middle of the page for the menu section. The reason for this was that it didn’t fit the stylistic seaside scheme that I wanted. I also added an extra image in the Book a table page.

**The User Story**

As a user I want the website to be easy to navigate. If I was local to the area I would be easily able find out the opening times so I could go to the takeaway myself. I can navigate all pages clearly and easily from the navigation bar. 

As a user I want to use a delivery service: I have included external links in the footer and in the header I have also provided internal links that go down to the footer for this. 

As a user I want to find out the location of the restaurant. This can be found on the contact us page. 

As a user I would like to book online. The form makes this possible. 

**Testing.** 

I tested the website that I created on Lighthouse and hear are the following results. The speed index came in at 2.5s accessibility received 93 out of 100. 

I also manually tested the responsiveness of the design in the google chrome developer tools where it work in phone tablet and desktop size. 

A recurring problem that I did not manage to resolve was a drop down box within the Nav bar. I had major issues around responsiveness with this and the dropdown box that would have had  the links to delivery services in would disappear at any below the desktop level of 1200px.
   
 As explained above I also have the issue of gitpod rejecting the commits for my CSS file. I have been unable to figure this out ![Screenshot 2021-10-29 at 16 31 06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89813192/139573968-f71a5602-dc1b-40fc-a2b0-1f034e0a731d.png)

   
   
I have also passed my code through the w3 HTML and CSS checker with the following results for the four pages. 
   
   **index**
   When I initially put the code through I had incurred 6 errors these for mainly Div tags that havent been closed properly. Another error that I found occured    frequently was the correct syntax for &. I had worked out that in order for it to be visible I had to included amp aftter the symbol but not that it needed to be closed off with a semi-colon.

   **menu*!
   
   I had 8 errors that occured when I put the menu page through the HTML checker. I managed to narrow this down to theb are minimum of two errors. These were within the footer and did not effect any of the outputs.

   *book a table*
   
   I had 5 errors on the book a table page that I was able to remove including 1 Fatal error. I removed the fatal error by going back to my preivously saved code on github and repasting in the code line by line. this solved the problem and I have a clean code uploaded now.

   *contact us*
   
   I kept 5 errors in my Contact us page as that was the Iframe. The error was that the attribute elements were obsolete and I should use CSS however GITPOD will not upload my CSS.

**Deployment** 

The website has been deployed to git-hub pages as sh-fish-chips
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89813192/139556364-f2a082af-8843-4e04-90c6-b172a15f291b.png)

   
   
Process of deplyment is as following 
   
   Logged into gthub 
   
   The repositary for the project is https://github.com/samhodgson88/sh-fish-chips   
   
   click on "settings" on the main menu over the file listing.
   
   Navigate down to github pages and click the link. 
   
   select master branch from the menu.
   
   A live link opens and is now viewablew publicly. 
   
   
   
 **Acknowledgement and thanks**   
   
   I used the following programmes to create this website. 
   
   HTML and CSS are the main three technologies used for the build in additon I used the following. 
   
   Gitpod: As the workspace used to write the code.
   
   Github: to save the code and I have used github to write the readme document. 
   
   Bootstrap: I have used this throughout in order to create a responsive web design or mobile screens and larger.
   
   googlefonts: was used throughout.
   
   W3c Markup validation service  used to check HTML code.
   
   CSS validation services to create CSS code.
   
   Lighthouse extension for google chrome.
   
   Google chrome develop tools:
   
   Free front end: was used form my footer although I modified this slightly. 
   
   I would also like to thank Felipe Souza Alarcon for his time and help. The outcome from this project is not what I wanted.
   however I think the issue with gitpod goes outside the remit of this project and I will speak to code academy regarding the re-submission process.
